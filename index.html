                <h3 class="small">A little bit about me</h3>
                <p>I’m 27 years old, and have lived in Arizona for about 4 years now.  Before this I was a student at California State University fo Long Beach where I got my bachelors degree in mechanical engineering.  At the end of my time at CSULB, I decided that career wasn’t for me and wanted to focus on the more physical side of fabrication.</p>
                <p>Since my move I have been focusing on learning all the different ways to stay self-reliant.  This includes more fabrication techniques, various medical topics, and trying to learn how to run my business with as little outside contracting needing to be done as possible.  Hence, learning to deisgn websites.</p>
